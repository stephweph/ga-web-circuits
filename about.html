	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I'm a Content Manager for the Capital One microsites team, living in Richmond, Va. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because even though I work within a CMS daily, in the microsites team we are allowed to stray from the portal standard. Learning the front-end will help when troubleshooting those times when the content isn't rendering properly. </p>
	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a UI/UX developer with Capital One because I love the collaborative environment of the campus, you feel like you work more for places like Google and Facebook, rather than a financial institution. </p>
	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
	<ul>
